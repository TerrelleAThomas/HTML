	  <p>My name is Terrelle Thomas. I am an international student from a small island located in the Caribbean called St. Maarten. I was born on September 12, 2000. I am part of a family of five that consists of both my parents and my older brother and sister. I have been a student at TCC for the last three years. I graduated from TCC with an associate degree in the Spring 2021 semester. I just transferred to FAMU for Fall 2021 from Tallahassee Community College. My degree major is Computer Information Systems with a minor in cybersecurity and computer science. I am highly skilled in playing basketball, Microsoft office suite, and being a leader. My classification at Famu currently is junior. There are many hobbies extracurricular activities that participate every day. Some examples of these activities are playing video, learning new stuff, playing basketball, and more. During my high school and primary school days, I played different basketball tournaments locally for my school. The motivational word that I always keep in my head is that donâ€™t ever give up.</p>
	<p>I chose to study Computer Information Systems with a minor in cybersecurity and computer science because I aspire to become a forensic scientist/computer specialist. I want to work for the US Army Cybersecurity Division. Then  I want to build up my own cybersecurity company and help out any government agency. Also I want to bulid up an information technology business with my big brother where we work any aspect of the IT industry. My family and up helped me to stay motivated through my ups and downs. Before picking this profession, at a young age, I wanted to become a pilot. But that changed when I started to watch criminal television such as NCIS, Criminals, and other criminals show.</p>
