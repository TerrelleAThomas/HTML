<p>Inspiration is the process of being mentally stimulated to do or feel something, especially
to do something creatively. Over the years, I have many  people who has inspired me. Some of those people were my brother, mother and more. But the person who had inspirate me the most was NBA Great Kobe Bryant.</p>
<p>Kobe Bryant was a professional basketball who played for the Los Angeles Lakers for twenty years at the shooting guard position. He was widely known as one the most incredible professional player who played that had many accolades. He was born on August 23, 1978, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Bryant was the youngest of three children and the son of former NBA players. In 1984, when his father's career ended and they mover to Italy. While in Italy, Kobe and his sister were avid players of basketball and soccer. After spending seven years in Italy, Kobe and his family moved back to Philadelphia, where he began his basketball career. That is when Bryant joined the Lower Merion High School basketball team and won multiple state championships. Even though with good academic standards, he decided to skip college and went to the NBA. Kobe decided to declare the NBA Draft in 1996. He was selected by the Charlotte Hornets with thirteen overall picks but was traded to the Los Angeles Lakers, where he played for his entire career and obtained many accolades.</p>
<p>Kobe Bryant was an inspiration to me for many reasons. Kobe Bryant was an inspiration to me for his work ethic, perseverance, being family-oriented, role model, and many more reasons. But the main reason why he was inspiration was how he held  himself throughout his ups and downs in his life</p>
